# **[Text_processing :](/Text_processing/)** 
    
    Apply some text mining methods and algorithms(TF,IDF, NMF, TOPIC MODELING).

>Texts are pre-treated and cleaned using the basic text processing techniques such as :  
```removing stop words```, `lemmatization`, `stemming`, `tokenization`,` removing punctuation`, `removing numbers`,` and` `removing special characters`.

> Then we've applied some text mining algorithms such as : `TF-IDF`, `NMF`, `Topic Modeling`.

    The following picture show one of the returned results: evolution of the most common topics by time in the one month.
